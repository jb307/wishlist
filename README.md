# Personal Project
This website was built as a personal project.

** Problem **

The problem was keeping links in my phone notes in order to save things that i wanted on my phone. I would forget and then just create a whole new note, and sharing notes with others was a hassel since I would create multiple notes.



** Solution **

I created this website as a fix to all the note taking. I am able to update my list regulary. All of my wanted items are on the same list catagorized accordingly. Pictures and direct links are added to facilite buying, there are also price filters and a MOST WANTED filter.
